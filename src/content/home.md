# RPlayer

A lightweight, powerful audio player for streaming radio.

Experience the power of RPlayer in action with our interactive demo below. This integrated player and radio search showcase demonstrates how RPlayer can handle various audio formats seamlessly while providing a rich user experience.

Unlike traditional audio players, RPlayer automatically detects and adapts to different streaming formats, including HLS (.m3u8) with adaptive bitrate, standard MP3/AAC streams, and M3U playlists. The player handles all the complexity behind the scenes, giving you a simple, unified API.
